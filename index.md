---
OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning and in general to aid penetration testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports(in HTML/TXT/JSON/CSV format) for applications and networks, including discovering open ports, services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials, subdomains, etc. Nettacker can be run as a command-line utility (including running as a Docker container), API, Web GUI mode or as Maltego transforms. 

OWASP Nettacker is written in 100% Python and does not rely on launching any external tools.

On October 31st 2023 OWASP Nettacker [v0.3.2](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/releases/tag/0.3.2) was released with new modules to scan networks for Critical vulnerabilities such as: Adobe Coldfusion CVE-2023-26360, Atlassian Confluence CVE-2023-22515 and Citrix Netscaler CVE-2023-4966.
