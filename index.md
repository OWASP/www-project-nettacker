pitch: OWASP Nettacker is an open source software in Python language which helps you to perform automated penetration testing and automated Information Gathering.
---
OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning and in general to aid penetration testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports(in HTML/TXT/JSON/CSV format) for applications and networks, including discovering open ports, services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials, subdomains, etc. Nettacker can be run as a command-line utility (including running as a Docker container), API, Web GUI mode or as Maltego transforms. 

OWASP Nettacker is written in 100% Python and does not rely on launching any external tools.

OWASP Nettacker can also help you find instances of critically vulnerable MOVEit Transfer, Citrix Netscaler, Ivanti ICS/EPMM services and other vulnerabilities in your network.
